        My name is Luan Ngo. &nbsp;I have been working for Boeing for more than eight years. &nbsp;Mostly, I work as a programmer supporting and developing customization to Teamcenter using C, Java, C++. &nbsp;About nine years ago, I started to learn HTML, JavaScript, and ASP on my own. &nbsp;I even setup a IIS to execute ASP and lost interstest in it when I got hired for Boeing.  Anyway, I recently moved to St. Louis and got bored and decided to do something productive like taking HTML5 to pick up new skills. &nbsp;I am looking forward to learn new things in HTML5 and CSS.
